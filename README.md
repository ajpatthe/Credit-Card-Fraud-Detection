# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques in Python. It utilizes the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which contains a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset is preprocessed to handle imbalanced data, missing values, and feature scaling before training various machine learning models. Algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks are applied to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Performance evaluation is done using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to determine the best-performing model. The project is implemented in Jupyter Notebook using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib for data visualization. This project provides a practical approach to fraud detection and is useful for financial institutions looking to enhance security and minimize fraudulent activities. To set up, install the required Python libraries and run the notebook to train and evaluate the models.
